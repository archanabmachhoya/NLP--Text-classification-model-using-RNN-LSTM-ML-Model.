Text classification model to determine whether Instagram posts are related to pavbhaji or not using RNN  LSTM and ML Model.(NLP)

1. Data Collection: Collect a dataset of Instagram posts that are labeled as either being about pavbhaji or not.
2. Data Preprocessing: This involves cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and converting text data into numerical vectors.
3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed text data. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (such as Word2Vec or GloVe), or character embeddings.
4. Model Building: Build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for text classification.
Build a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.
5. Model Training: Train both the RNN LSTM and Naive Bayes classifiers on the labeled Instagram post data.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of both models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Model Comparison: Compare the performance of the RNN LSTM and Naive Bayes classifiers to determine which one performs better for this task.
